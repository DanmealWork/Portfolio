I am a fourth-year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Central Lancashire, specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Throughout my academic journey, ANSYS Fluent, a powerful CFD software, has been integral to my work in both my third and fourth-year projects.

During my third year, I conducted comprehensive simulations and analysis to investigate the flow characteristics within a custom-designed rocket nozzle, leveraging the capabilities of ANSYS Fluent. These simulations provided valuable insights into the internal conditions of the nozzle. In my fourth-year project, I utilized ANSYS Fluent to accurately predict and analyze the aerodynamic properties of a morphing wing.

To further augment my expertise in CFD, I have actively pursued additional education through Udemy courses led by Dr. Aidan Wimshurst. These courses have equipped me with a deep understanding of the underlying principles and functionalities of CFD solvers. Moreover, recognizing the prominence of OpenFOAM as a widely used CFD package, I have independently acquired proficiency in its application, extending my capabilities within the field.

Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated proficiency in utilizing Solidworks for various 3D modeling tasks, effectively translating these skills to other software platforms. Additionally, I have leveraged the capabilities of Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor, to produce high-quality and professional documents.
