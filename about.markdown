4th year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Central Lancashire. 

I’ve been interested in rocket engines for a long time now, with an itch for years to do some practical rocketry. That itch came to fruition in college when I did my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in college. In that project, I applied basic rocket science to try and build a reusable model rocket powered by solid fuel motors.

ANSYS Fluent was used for my 3rd year project at UCLan in which I designed a nozzle for a theoretical rocket engine, and examined the supersonic flow properties within the nozzle. Currently, I’m using ANSYS Fluent to examine the airflow around a wing that will morph to change aerofoil shape mid-flight for my 4th year group project.

In my free time I’m working on a course for an introduction to OpenFoam on Udemy by Philip Baldock, with the aim in the future to be proficient in 2 different CFD solvers.
