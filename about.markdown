I am a fourth-year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Central Lancashire, specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Throughout my academic journey, ANSYS Fluent, a powerful CFD software, has been integral to my work in both my third and fourth-year projects.

During my third year, I conducted comprehensive simulations and analysis to investigate the flow characteristics within a custom-designed rocket nozzle, leveraging the capabilities of ANSYS Fluent. These simulations provided valuable insights into the internal conditions of the nozzle. In my fourth-year project, I utilized ANSYS Fluent to accurately predict and analyze the aerodynamic properties of a morphing wing.

While my proficiency in ANSYS Fluent is well-established, I have also recognized the growing importance of OpenFOAM as a widely used CFD package. To expand my skill set, I have independently embarked on learning OpenFOAM and familiarizing myself with its functionalities. While my expertise in OpenFOAM is currently in its developmental stages, I am actively gaining proficiency through self-study and practical applications. I acknowledge the significance of OpenFOAM in the industry and remain committed to enhancing my skills in this area.

In addition to my CFD knowledge, I have demonstrated proficiency in utilizing Solidworks for various 3D modeling tasks, effectively translating these skills to other software platforms. Furthermore, I have leveraged the capabilities of Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor, to produce high-quality and professional documents.

I believe in the continuous pursuit of knowledge and the adaptability required in the ever-evolving field of Aerospace Engineering. By combining my expertise in ANSYS Fluent with my ongoing efforts to master OpenFOAM, I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to any CFD-related projects and embrace the challenges of the industry.
