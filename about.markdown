4th year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Central Lancashire. 

I am strongly interested in liquid propellant rocket engines, with an even deeper interest in the thrust chamber portion of the engine. Skills I possess include CFD analysis, FEA (both using ANSYS packages) and modelling in Solidworks.
