# Coming Soon
- Currently working on: correctly modeling rotating tyres and overcoming validation problems

# Overview
This section introduces a basic F1 style car model released by an imaginary open-seat sporting body, along with an imaginary set of regulations, with the aim of applying relevant aerodynamics knowledge and CFD skills to improve the performance of the base model. Shown below is the model produced by this sporting body:

        <img alt="F1 Car Concept" src="/assets/img/concept-f1-car.png" />
    </div>    
</div>

The model is roughly based on the highly successful McLaren MP4/4, and the only regulations to adhere to are as follows:

- Length must not exceed 3 metres
- Width must not exceed 1.5 metres (with tyres fitted)
- Height must not exceed 1 metre
- The floor of the car must be 50mm from the ground

These regulations leave a vast range of options to explore, which will be investigated later in this section.
