The 2 videos below show flow over a sphere at 2 different Reynolds numbers (20 and 200). These videos are here to show that Iâ€™ve successfully set up a transient simulation using the PISO algorithm and with the K-epsilon turbulence model. The initial values for k, epsilon, nu, etc., were chosen arbitrarily, with the aim on being able to run a simulation.
