# Variation of Reynolds Number Across a Cylinder Section
The following 4 videos and screenshots show flow over a cylinder of diameter 2mm for varying Reynolds numbers: 17.5, 35, 70 and 280. Transient simulations were set up for each of the simulations with the K-omega SST model deployed with appropriate values of K and omega assigned for each of the differing Reynolds numbers.
